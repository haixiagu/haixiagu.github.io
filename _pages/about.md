Haixia Gu is a Ph.D. student in Genetics at the School of Life Science, Central South University, China. Her research is dedicated to precisely defining and measuring psychological stress, while exploring its critical role in the development and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Specifically, she aims to:

1. Comprehensively define and reliably quantify psychological stress, and

2. Investigate its causal relationships with psychiatric disorders using both phenotypic and genetic approaches.

With a multidisciplinary background spanning psychology and genetics, Haixia has received comprehensive training in experimental psychology, psychological assessment, cognitive neurobiology, bioinformatics, genetics, and epigenetics. Her experience includes designing and executing psychological studies in laboratory settings, as well as performing genetic analyses in large-scale cohort datasets such as [Lifelines](https://www.lifelines-biobank.com/), [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), and [NESDA](https://www.nesda.nl/).



# 🔥 News

[Salivary Cortisol Responses to Acute Stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666497622000169?via%3Dihub)


[**Main findings**]
<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- The TSST effectively induces stress response as measured by salivary cortisol change.
- Forty samples is the minimum for detecting robust salivary cortisol responses.
- The speech topics tested did not significantly alter salivary cortisol responses.
- Males have higher salivary cortisol responses than females in the TSST.
- Males had higher salivary cortisol levels than females in the TSST at both baseline and peak.

[**Main findings**]
<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Human organoids are three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cell cultures that accurately mimic the cell types, tissue structures, and other essential characteristics of human organs.
- In this review, we summarized the methods and advancements in using phenomics to study human organoids, and outline prospects for their future development and application.
